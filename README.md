# Worgbox
Growbox with Arduino based controller

##Introduction
Growbox named 'Worgbox'. What do I mean? 'Worg' and 'box'. 'Worg' in parallel universe sounds like 'Grow'. 
No need to explain you how we can travel there :]
Main idea I want to make a compact and controlled box for growing something small in compact area and possible stealthy.

##Construction
Dimensions 260mm x 260mm x 470mm
Material is 6mm plywood


##How It Work

###TO DO Construction
- using bigger holles for wires (up to 5 mm diameter)
- separate high voltage and low voltage compartments;


###TO DO Hardware
- kill the freezes and stop working of controller (need shield);
- make PCB for working with Arduino Mini Pro;
- setup temeprature sensor to the LED radiators;
- read white wire data from the fans (for RPM analyze);

###TO DO Software
- analyze fans RPM;

###Ideas
- migrate totally to ESP8266
